This is the version of the course taught in 2017-18;
course_outline.tex should give an outline of the course, the
individual chapters are in the numbered folders; the source folders
contain LaTeX files and code snippets, the misc folder is for stuff
that I might do but haven't put into its place yet.

The course doesn't follow a particular text book but 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms

is recommended.
